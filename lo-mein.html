    <h1>Lo-mein Recipe</h1>
    <p>
      Lo Mein (撈麵 / lāo miàn) literally translates to "stirred noodles" in
      Cantonese. The dish originated in China, with its history tracing back to
      ancient Chinese noodle-making traditions that date back over 4,000 years.
      Unlike its cousin Chow Mein ("fried noodles"), Lo Mein is made by cooking
      the noodles separately until they're almost done, then adding them to the
      wok to be tossed with other ingredients and sauce. The focus is more on
      the "stirring" or "tossing" rather than frying. Originally, Lo Mein was
      served as a soup noodle dish in China. However, as Chinese cuisine spread
      across the world, particularly in America through Chinese immigrants in
      the 19th and 20th centuries, it evolved into the stir-fried dish we know
      today. The American version typically includes more sauce and vegetables
      than its traditional Chinese counterpart. In traditional Chinese dining,
      noodle dishes like Lo Mein were considered casual fare, often eaten for
      breakfast or lunch rather than at formal dinners. Today, it's become one
      of the most popular Chinese-American dishes, adapted to local tastes while
      maintaining its essential character of soft, chewy noodles in a savory
      sauce. The type of noodle used is also significant - authentic Lo Mein
      uses wheat flour-based eggs noodles, which give the dish its
      characteristic texture and ability to hold the sauce well.
